;; A Graph is a (listof X) where X is a two element list (a “pair”):
;; (list v (list w_1 ... w_n)). Each pair contains a node name
;; (a symbol) and a list of out-neighbours (a list of symbols).

;; An undirected graph (UGraph) is a graph G such 
;; that for any two nodes u and v in G, if there 
;; is an edge from u to v, there is also an edge from 
;; v to u.

;; a.)
;; (directed->undirected dgraph) produces the corresponding
;;    undirected graph to the given [dgraph].

;; Examples:
