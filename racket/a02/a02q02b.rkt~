;; (roadmap-step currentStep oneDose twoDose daySinceStep outbreak?) produces true if the province
;; is ready to progress into the next step, and false otherwise. The province's readiness
;; relies on [oneDose], the % of people with one vaccine, [twoDose], the % of people with two,
;; [daySinceStep], the number of days since the province moved into the current step,
;; and [outbreak?], the province's indicator if there is an outbreak.

;; Examples:
(check-expect (ready-for-next-step? 'step1 20 100 20 false) false)
(check-expect (ready-for-next-step? 'step0 65 30 20 false) true)
(check-expect (ready-for-next-step? 'step1 75 100 25 false) false)

;; ready-for-next-step?: Sym Nat Nat Nat Bool -> Sym
;; oneDose and twoDose are natural numbers less than 100 and
;; currentStep can only be one of the following symbols: 'step0, 'step1, 'step2, 'step3
