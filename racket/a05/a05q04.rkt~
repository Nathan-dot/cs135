;; A Ranked-List is a (listof Sym) that may include the symbol 'sentinel, which can appear anywhere
;;   in the list and indicates a stopping point where only elements before 'sentinel should be
;;   considered.
;;   Requires: The given list cannot contain duplicates.

;; A QuestionNum is an Int value
;;   Requires: The value must be 1 or larger

;; An Answer is (anyof Bool Str Int Ranked-List)

;; A Response is a (list QuestionNum Answer)


;; b.)
;; (response-similarity response1 response2) produces the similarity of
;;    the two Response [response1] and [response2], which is measured by
;;    a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
