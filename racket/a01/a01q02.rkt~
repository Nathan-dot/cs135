;; a.)
;; (reaction-distance pr-time speed) consumes the perception-reaction time in seconds
;; and the car's speed in kilometers per hour to produce the distance a moving vehicle
;; travels during the perception-reaction time
;; pr-time > 0, speed >= 0

;; Examples:
(check-expect (reaction-distance 60 1.3) 21.684)
(check-expect (reaction-distance 45 1.5) 18.765)

;; reaction-distance: Num Num -> Num

(define (reaction-distance pr-time speed)
  (* 0.278 pr-time speed)) ;0.278 is a reaction-distance coefficient

;; Tests:
(check-expect (reaction-distance 53 6.0) 88.404)
(check-expect (reaction-distance 45 0) 0)
(check-expect (reaction-distance 1.5 60) 25.02)

;; b.)
;; (braking-distance speed slope friction) consumes a vehicle's speed in kilometer per hour, the
;; slope of the road, and the coefficient of friction between the vehicle's tires
;; and the road to calculate the distance needed for moving vehicle to stop after braking
;; (s+f) > 0
;; Helper Function for stopping-distance


;; Examples:
(check-within (braking-distance 45 0 0.7) 11.39 0.01)
(check-within (braking-distance 25 1.2 0.3) 1.64 0.01)

(define dry-friction 0.7)
(define wet-friction 0.5)

;; (stopping-distance speed pr-time slope friction) consumes the vehicle's speed, perception-reaction time
