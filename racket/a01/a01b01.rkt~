;; (topmarks clickerQ correctQ incorrectQ) consumes
;; the total amount of clicker questions asked, the number a student
;; answers correctly, and the number a student answers incorrectly
;; to calculate their total mark value.

;; Examples:
(check-expect (topmarks 28 1 26) 22)
(check-expect (topmarks 28 24 3) 42)
(check-expect (topmarks 28 0 0) 0)

;; topmarks: Nat Nat Nat -> Num
;; (Under assumption that at least one clicker question is asked per term)

;; Note: clickerQ is always a positive integer divisible by four
(define (topmarks clickerQ correctQ incorrectQ)
  (+ (min (* correctQ 2) (* 0.75 clickerQ 2))
     (* (min (max (- (* 0.75 clickerQ) correctQ) 0) incorrectQ) 1)))

;; Tests:
(check-expect (topmarks 28 28 0) 42)
(check-expect (topmarks 112 34 2) 70)
(check-expect (topmarks 112 2 34) 38)
(check-expect (topmarks 28 0 28) 21)


;; (cs1110-participation clickerQ correctQ, incorrectQ) consumes
;; the total amount of clicker questions asked, the number a student
;; answers correctly, and the number a student answers incorrectly to
;; calculate the student's grade as percentage 
;; (using only their best 75% of the clicker questions asked)

;; Examples:
(check-within (cs1110-participation 28 15 12) 85.71 0.01)
(check-expect (cs1110-participation 1 0 1) 50)

;; cs1110-participation: Nat Nat Nat -> Num

(define (cs1110-participation clickerQ correctQ incorrectQ)
  (* (/ (topmarks clickerQ correctQ incorrectQ) (* clickerQ 0.75 2)) 100))

;; Tests:
