;; (pressure->loudness sound-pressure) consumes sound-pressure (Pascals)
;; and produces a loudness measurement in decibels

;; Examples:
(check-expect (pressure->loudness 0.00002) 0)
(check-within (pressure->loudness 0.89) 92.97 0.01)

;; pressure->loudness: Num -> Num

(define pressure-ref (* 2 (expt 10 -5)))
;; reference level pressure that corresponds to human hearing threshold

(define (pressure->loudness sound-pressure)
  (* 20 (log (/ sound-pressure pressure-ref) 10)))

;; Tests:
(check-within (pressure->loudness 0.65) 90.24 0.01)
(check-within (pressure->loudness 0.35) 84.86 0.01)
