;; A Label is a Str
  
;; An Outcome is (anyof 'fc 'a 'b), where:
;; 'fc (the question attempt is correct on the first try before the deadline)
;; 'a (the question attempt is eventually correct before the deadline)

(define-struct marked-sc (label outcome))
;; A MarkedSC is a (make-marked-sc Label Outcome)
  
;; A LabelList is a (listof Label)
;; Requires: every label is unique; the list is sorted in strictly 
;;   increasing order lexicographically 
  
;; A MarkedSCList is a (listof MarkedSC)
;; Requires: each label across MarkedSCs is unique; the list is sorted in
;;   strictly increasing order lexicographically by label

;; a.)
;; (insert-marked-sc marked-sc sc-list) produces [sc-list] with the element
;;   [marked-sc] inserted. The element's insertion location in the list is
;;   determined lexicographically in increasing order by each [marked-sc]'s label.
;;   If [marked-sc] shares the same label with one already in the list, the element
;;   is still replaced by it.
